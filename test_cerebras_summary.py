    deep learning techniques applied to medical imaging, including convolutional neural networks 
    (CNNs) for image classification, segmentation, and detection. We evaluate the performance 
    of various architectures on multiple medical imaging datasets and demonstrate significant 
    improvements over traditional methods. Our results show that deep learning models can achieve

Generate TWO summaries for this research paper:

1. SHORT SUMMARY (3-5 sentences): A concise overview covering the main objective, methodology, key findings, and significance.

2. EXPANDED SUMMARY (8-12 sentences): A more detailed summary that includes:
   - Research context and motivation
   - Detailed methodology and approach
   - Comprehensive findings and results
   - Implications and significance
   - Limitations and future directions

Title: {test_article['title']}

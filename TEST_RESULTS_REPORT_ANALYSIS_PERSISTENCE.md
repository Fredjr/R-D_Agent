## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Total Endpoints Fixed: 8

1. ✅ `GET /reports/{report_id}` - Line 6384
2. ✅ `GET /deep-dive-analyses/{analysis_id}` - Line 6332
3. ✅ `GET /projects/{project_id}/deep-dive-analyses` - Line 6034
4. ✅ `GET /projects/{project_id}/deep-dive-analyses/{analysis_id}` - Line 6216
5. ✅ `POST /projects/{project_id}/deep-dive-analyses` - Line 6904
6. ✅ `POST /projects/{project_id}/reports` - Line 5652
7. ✅ `GET /projects/{project_id}/reports` - Line 5890
8. ✅ `GET /projects/{project_id}/reports/{report_id}` - Line 5988

### Fix Pattern Applied:
```python
# Before
current_user = request.headers.get("User-ID", "default_user")
Project.owner_user_id == current_user  # ❌ Comparing UUID with email

# After
current_user = request.headers.get("User-ID", "default_user")
user_id = resolve_user_id(current_user, db)  # ✅ Convert email → UUID
Project.owner_user_id == user_id  # ✅ Comparing UUID with UUID
```

## 🎯 User Experience Verification

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Users saw 403 errors when clicking saved reports
- ❌ Users saw 403 errors when clicking saved analyses
- ❌ Project dashboard couldn't list reports
- ❌ Reports/analyses appeared saved but were inaccessible

### After Fix:
- ✅ Users can click and view saved reports
- ✅ Users can click and view saved analyses
- ✅ Project dashboard lists all reports
- ✅ Project dashboard lists all analyses
- ✅ Full content is displayed in UI

---

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Authorization Tests:

**Test:** User can access own resources ✅
- User fredericle77@gmail.com can access reports with created_by = their UUID
- User fredericle77@gmail.com can access analyses with created_by = their UUID

**Test:** User cannot access other user's resources ✅
- Authorization checks verify project ownership
- Authorization checks verify user_id matches
- 403 Forbidden returned for unauthorized access

**Test:** Email → UUID resolution works correctly ✅
- Frontend sends: `User-ID: fredericle77@gmail.com`
- Backend resolves to: `e29e29d3-f87f-4c70-9aeb-424002382195`
- Database queries use UUID for comparison

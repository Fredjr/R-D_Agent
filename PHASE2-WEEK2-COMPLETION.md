   - Added imports for AnalysisTab and ProgressTab
   - Updated tab state type to include 'analysis' and 'progress'
   - Updated URL parameter handling for new tabs
   - Added 2 new tabs to SpotifyProjectTabs configuration
   - Added tab content rendering for Analysis and Progress

### **Key Changes:**

**Tab State Type:**
```typescript

  'research-question' | 'explore' | 'collections' | 'notes' | 'analysis' | 'progress'
>('research-question');
```

**New Tab Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'analysis',
  label: 'Analysis',
  icon: '📊',
  count: (reports.length + deep_dives.length),
  description: 'Reports and deep dive analyses'
},
{
  id: 'progress',
  label: 'Progress',
  icon: '📈',
  description: 'Activity timeline and metrics'
}
```

**Tab Content Rendering:**
```typescript
{activeTab === 'analysis' && (
  <AnalysisTab
    project={project}
    onGenerateReport={() => setShowReportModal(true)}
    onGenerateDeepDive={() => setShowDeepDiveModal(true)}
  />
)}

{activeTab === 'progress' && (
  <ProgressTab project={project} />
)}
```

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### **What Went Well:**
1. ✅ Clear roadmap made implementation straightforward
2. ✅ Component reuse (existing modals, styles)
3. ✅ TypeScript caught errors early
4. ✅ Build process smooth and fast
5. ✅ Test script comprehensive

### **Challenges:**
1. ⚠️ Icon import issue (`TrendingUpIcon` → `ArrowTrendingUpIcon`)
2. ⚠️ Need real activity data for Progress tab (currently placeholder)
3. ⚠️ Deep dives data structure unclear (used `deep_dives` array)

### **Improvements for Next Phase:**
1. Add backend API for activity tracking
2. Create reusable metric card component
3. Add loading states for tab content
4. Implement tab content caching
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for tab navigation

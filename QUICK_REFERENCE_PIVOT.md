# 📋 Quick Reference: Strategic Pivot

**Last Updated**: November 17, 2025

---

## 🎯 The Pivot in 3 Bullets

1. **FROM**: "AI literature tool" competing with ResearchRabbit  
   **TO**: "Research project OS" owning the layer above literature tools

2. **FROM**: Paper-centered workflow (search → explore → collect)  
   **TO**: Project-centered workflow (questions → hypotheses → experiments)

3. **FROM**: Competing with mature players in crowded market  
   **TO**: Blue ocean opportunity with clear differentiation

## 🚫 STOP Doing (Deprioritize)

| Feature | Why Stop | What Instead |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Better citation maps | ResearchRabbit has 5-year head start | Keep current, don't improve |
| Generic AI chat | Commoditized (everyone has GPT-4) | Project-specific AI |
| Full reference manager | Zotero/Mendeley are entrenched | Integration, not replacement |
| Horizontal "AI for science" | Too broad, can't win vs Google/Anthropic | Vertical: PhD + biotech workflows |

---

## ✅ START Doing (Build)

| Priority | Feature | Timeline | Impact |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Research question hierarchy | Month 1 | Core differentiator |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Question → paper linking | Month 1 | Project-first structure |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Decision timeline | Month 1 | Track pivots & rationale |
| 🟡 HIGH | Hypothesis modeling | Month 2 | Scientific workflow |
| 🟡 HIGH | Project-centered triage | Month 3 | Smart assistant |
| 🟡 HIGH | Living field summary | Month 4 | Auto-updating lit review |
| 🟢 MEDIUM | Protocol extraction | Month 5 | Lab bridge |
| 🟢 MEDIUM | Experiment planning | Month 6 | Full workflow |

## 🎨 New Positioning

### Tagline
**"The research project OS that turns papers into a living plan"**

### One-Liner
"ResearchRabbit shows you what papers exist. We show you what to DO with them."

### Value Props (New Order)
1. 🎯 Project-First: Your research questions, not just papers
2. 🧠 Smart Triage: AI tells you which papers matter to YOUR project
3. 🔬 Literature → Lab: Turn papers into protocols and experiments
4. 🤝 Team Memory: Preserve the "why" behind every decision
5. 📊 Living Summary: Your literature review updates itself

---

## 👥 Target Users

### Primary: PhD Students (Years 1-3)
**Pain**: "I have 200 papers but no clear research plan"  
**Solution**: Structured question → hypothesis → evidence workflow  
**Wedge**: Free for students, supervisor endorsement  

### Secondary: Biotech R&D Scientists
**Pain**: "New scientist takes 6 months to onboard"  
**Solution**: Literature context for every experiment  
**Wedge**: Faster onboarding = $50K+ savings  

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (6 Months)

### Product
- 80% of projects use question hierarchy
- 60% of projects have ≥1 hypothesis
- 50% of papers linked to questions
- 40% generate living summary

### Business
- 2x increase in 6-month retention
- 3x increase in weekly active projects
- 10 design partner labs
- 5 university partnerships

research_questions (question hierarchy)
question_evidence (papers linked to questions)
hypotheses (linked to questions)
hypothesis_evidence (papers linked to hypotheses)

-- Intelligence layer
project_decisions (decision log with rationale)
paper_triage (must read / nice to know / ignore)
project_alerts (new papers affecting your project)
field_summaries (living summaries with versions)

-- Lab bridge
protocols (extracted from papers)
experiments (linked to hypotheses & protocols)
```

## 💡 Key Insights from Strategic Analysis

### Why We're in Trouble Now
1. **Crowded market**: ResearchRabbit, Litmaps, Connected Papers, Inciteful
2. **Commoditized AI**: Everyone can call GPT-4
3. **No moat**: "Better summaries" won't last
4. **Wrong competition**: Fighting mature players on their turf

### Why Pivot Will Work
1. **Underserved need**: No one owns "research project" layer
2. **Clear differentiation**: Project-first vs paper-first
3. **Workflow lock-in**: Harder to switch once structured
4. **Expansion path**: PhD → biotech → pharma
5. **Integration strategy**: Work WITH ResearchRabbit, not against

### The Jobs-to-be-Done We're Missing
1. ❌ Turn messy topic into concrete research plan
2. ❌ Stay on top of field over 3-5 years (project-centered)
3. ❌ Connect literature to experiments
4. ❌ Supervision & lab memory

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Users want simple tool | Medium | Keep "Simple Mode" + "Project Mode" |
| Too complex for students | Medium | Templates + guided wizard |
| Lab integration hard | High | Start with export, not bi-directional sync |
| Existing users resist | Low | Grandfather into "Classic Mode" |

---

## 📈 Competitive Positioning

### Before (WRONG)
```
Literature Discovery Space (Crowded)
- ResearchRabbit ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Litmaps ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Connected Papers ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- [US] ⭐⭐ ← Fighting uphill battle
```

### After (RIGHT)
```
Research Project Management (Blue Ocean)
- Notion (generic) ⭐⭐
- Benchling (lab-only) ⭐⭐⭐
- [US] ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ← Clear leader
```

---

## 🔄 Integration Strategy

### Upstream (Import)
✅ ResearchRabbit collections  
✅ Litmaps maps  
✅ Zotero/Mendeley libraries  
✅ Semantic Scholar search  

**Message**: "Keep using discovery tools you love. We add the project layer."

### Downstream (Export)
✅ Notion (project structure)  
✅ Overleaf/LaTeX (thesis chapters)  
✅ Word (literature reviews)  
✅ Benchling (protocols)  

**Message**: "Your research plan flows into writing and lab tools."

---

## 💰 Investment Required

- **Development**: 36 engineer-months over 6 months
- **Design Partners**: $15K incentives
- **Marketing**: $20K repositioning
- **Total**: ~$200-300K

---

## ✅ The Decision

### Recommended: PIVOT

**Why**: 
- Well-built foundation (network viz, AI, collaboration)
- Crowded current market (literature tools)
- Clear gap (project management layer)
- 6 months to prove it
- Massive upside (own research workflow)

**Next Step**: Team meeting → Commit → Execute Month 1

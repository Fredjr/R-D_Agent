- Real-time search as you type
- Categorized results
- Click result → Navigate to context
- Recent searches saved

**2. Advanced Filters**
- **Papers:** Filter by collection, year, citations, journal, has notes
- **Notes:** Filter by type, priority, status, tags (already exists, enhance)
- **Collections:** Filter by size, date, last updated
- **Reports/Analyses:** Filter by status, date (already exists)

### **Impact:**
- ⏱️ **Time to find item:** < 10 seconds (vs. 2-3 minutes manually)
- 📊 **Search success rate:** 90%+ (vs. 60% manual browsing)
- 🎯 **Filter usage:** 40%+ of searches
- 💡 **User satisfaction:** "Finally, I can find my notes!"

### **Timeline:** 2 weeks (Nov 4-17)
- Week 5: Global search
- Week 6: Advanced filters

- **Multiple sources:** PubMed Central, Unpaywall, DOI resolver
- **Highlight tool:** Select text → Create note
- **Reading list:** "Read Later" queue
- **Progress tracking:** Track reading completion
- **Reading time estimates:** Know how long papers take

### **Impact:**

**Collaboration:**
- 👥 **30%+ of projects** will have collaborators
- 🤝 **50%+ of teams** will use shared collections
- 📈 **Team productivity:** 2x faster research with collaboration
- 💬 **User feedback:** "Game-changer for our lab"

## 💡 FINAL THOUGHTS

**This is our moment to differentiate.**

ResearchRabbit has beautiful discovery. Zotero has collaboration. Mendeley has PDF reading. But **no one** has all three integrated into a complete research workspace.

After Phase 3 & 4, we'll be the **only platform** that:
- Helps you discover papers (like ResearchRabbit)
- Helps you organize and annotate (better than Zotero)
- Helps you collaborate with your team (like Mendeley)
- Helps you read and highlight (integrated, not separate)
- Helps you complete your research (unique to us)

**Let's build the future of research collaboration.** 🚀

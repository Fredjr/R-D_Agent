# 🔧 Onboarding Redirect Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Issue:** Search action redirected to dashboard instead of Research Hub  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

When a new user completed onboarding and chose **"Search for Papers"**, they were redirected to:
```
/dashboard?action=search
```

However, the dashboard page:
- ❌ Doesn't have a search modal
- ❌ Doesn't handle the `?action=search` parameter
- ❌ Just shows "Create First Project" prompt for new users

**Result:** User was confused - they chose "Search" but ended up on a page asking them to create a project.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Fixed Redirect URLs**

Updated `frontend/src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx` to redirect to the correct pages:

**Before:**
```typescript
if (firstAction === 'search') {
  router.push('/dashboard?action=search');  // ❌ Wrong!
} else if (firstAction === 'import') {
  router.push('/dashboard?action=import');  // ❌ Wrong!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (firstAction === 'search') {
  // Redirect to Research Hub (home page) which has MeSH search
  router.push('/?onboarding=search');  // ✅ Correct!
} else if (firstAction === 'import') {
  // Redirect to Research Hub with import hint
  router.push('/?onboarding=import');  // ✅ Correct!
}
```

### **2. Updated Action Descriptions**

Updated `frontend/src/components/onboarding/Step3FirstAction.tsx` to accurately describe where users will go:

**Before:**
- "Find papers in your research area using PubMed search"
- "Add papers you're already working with by PMID"
- "Explore what's popular and highly cited in your field"

**After:**
- "Use our Research Hub to search PubMed with MeSH terms" ✅
- "Import papers you're already working with using PMIDs or DOIs" ✅
- "Explore personalized recommendations based on your interests" ✅

### **3. Added Dashboard URL Parameter Handler**

Updated `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to handle `?action=create_project`:

```typescript
// Handle URL parameters from onboarding
useEffect(() => {
  const action = searchParams.get('action');
  if (action === 'create_project' && user && !authLoading) {
    // Auto-open create project modal after a short delay
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setShowCreateModal(true);
    }, 500);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [searchParams, user, authLoading]);
```

## 🎯 New Redirect Flow

### **After Onboarding Completion:**

| User Chooses | Redirects To | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Search for Papers** | `/?onboarding=search` | Research Hub with MeSH search interface |
| **Import Papers** | `/?onboarding=import` | Research Hub (can paste PMIDs/DOIs) |
| **Discover Papers** | `/discover?onboarding=trending` | Discover page with personalized recommendations |
| **Create a Project** | `/dashboard?action=create_project` | Dashboard with create project modal auto-opened |
| **Skip** | `/dashboard` | Dashboard (default view) |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

### **1. Handle `onboarding` URL Parameters**

Add handlers in Research Hub and Discover pages:

**Research Hub (`/`):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const onboarding = searchParams.get('onboarding');
  if (onboarding === 'search') {
    // Auto-focus search input
    searchInputRef.current?.focus();
  } else if (onboarding === 'import') {
    // Show tooltip: "Paste PMIDs or DOIs here"
  }
}, [searchParams]);
```

**Discover Page (`/discover`):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const onboarding = searchParams.get('onboarding');
  if (onboarding === 'trending') {
    // Scroll to trending section
    // Or show welcome message
  }
}, [searchParams]);
```

### **2. Add Welcome Messages**

Show contextual welcome messages based on onboarding choice:

- "Welcome! Start searching for papers in your research area..."
- "Welcome! Paste PMIDs or DOIs to import papers..."
- "Welcome! Here are papers recommended based on your interests..."

### **3. Track Onboarding Completion**

Add analytics to track:
- Which actions users choose
- Whether they complete their first action
- Time from onboarding to first meaningful interaction

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The onboarding redirect issue has been **fixed**. Users now land on the correct pages for their chosen actions, with accurate descriptions and smooth transitions.

**Ready to deploy and test on Vercel 85!** 🚀

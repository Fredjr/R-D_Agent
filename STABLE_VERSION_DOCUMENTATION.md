## Deployment Configuration

### Backend Railway Deployment
- **URL**: `https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/`
- **Health Check**: `GET /health` - Returns healthy status
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with complete schema
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: LLM integration (working)
  - `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`: Alternative LLM key (working)
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection (working)
  - `PORT`: Dynamic Railway port assignment

### Frontend Vercel Deployment  
- **URL**: `https://frontend-psi-seven-85.vercel.app/`
- **Project Dashboard**: `/project/{project_id}` - Working
- **Backend Integration**: Connected to Railway backend
- **Build Configuration**: React build with proper API endpoints

### Database Schema
- **PostgreSQL**: Complete schema with all tables
- **Tables**: Projects, Reports, DeepDiveAnalysis, ActivityLog, Users, etc.
- **Migrations**: All applied successfully
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys and constraints working

## API Endpoints Status

### Working Endpoints ✅
- `POST /generate-review` - Standalone workflow (77s)
- `POST /projects/{id}/reports/sync` - Project reports (69s)  
- `POST /projects/{id}/deep-dive-analyses/sync` - Deep dive (31s)
- `GET /projects/{id}/reports/{id}` - Individual report retrieval
- `GET /projects/{id}/deep-dive-analyses/{id}` - Individual analysis retrieval
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Project dashboard with statistics
- `GET /projects/{id}/activities` - Activity feed
- `GET /health` - System health check

### Known Limitations ⚠️
- **Background Processing**: Railway environment limitations with `asyncio.create_task()`
- **Workaround**: Synchronous endpoints provide full functionality
- **Impact**: None - synchronous processing faster than standalone

## System Architecture

### Processing Modes
1. **Synchronous Processing** ✅ WORKING
   - Immediate results in 30-77 seconds
   - Complete content generation
   - Reliable in Railway environment

2. **Background Processing** ⚠️ LIMITED  
   - Railway environment issues with complex async tasks
   - Simple tasks work, complex LLM processing hangs
   - Not needed due to synchronous performance

### Content Generation Pipeline
1. **Article Retrieval**: PubMed API integration
2. **Content Processing**: Google GenAI LLM analysis  
3. **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with JSON fields
4. **UI Display**: React components with proper formatting

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback Steps
1. **Git Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0-stable
   git push origin main --force
   ```

2. **Railway Deployment**:
   - Railway auto-deploys from main branch
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment completion
   - Verify health check: `curl https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/health`

3. **Database Rollback**:
   - Current schema is stable (no migrations needed)
   - If needed: restore from Railway database backup
   - Verify data integrity with test queries

4. **Verification Steps**:
   ```bash
   # Test standalone workflow
   curl -X POST "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/generate-review" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"molecule": "test", "objective": "test", "max_articles": 1}'
   
   # Test project dashboard
   curl "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/projects/{project_id}" \
     -H "User-ID: test@example.com"
   
   # Test health check
   curl "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/health"
   ```

### Environment Restoration
- **Railway**: Environment variables preserved in Railway dashboard
- **Vercel**: Environment variables preserved in Vercel dashboard  
- **Database**: Connection strings remain stable
- **API Keys**: Google GenAI keys working and preserved

- `GET /projects/{id}/deep-dive-analyses/{id}` - Individual analysis retrieval
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Project dashboard with statistics
- `GET /projects/{id}/activities` - Activity feed
- `GET /health` - System health check

### Known Limitations ⚠️
- **Background Processing**: Railway environment limitations with `asyncio.create_task()`
- **Workaround**: Synchronous endpoints provide full functionality
- **Impact**: None - synchronous processing faster than standalone

## System Architecture

### Processing Modes
1. **Synchronous Processing** ✅ WORKING
   - Immediate results in 30-77 seconds
   - Complete content generation
   - Reliable in Railway environment

2. **Background Processing** ⚠️ LIMITED  
   - Railway environment issues with complex async tasks
   - Simple tasks work, complex LLM processing hangs
   - Not needed due to synchronous performance

### Content Generation Pipeline
1. **Article Retrieval**: PubMed API integration
2. **Content Processing**: Google GenAI LLM analysis  
3. **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with JSON fields
4. **UI Display**: React components with proper formatting

## Step-by-Step Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback to Current Stable (6740763)

If future development breaks the system, use these steps to rollback to the current known-good state:

#### 1. Git Rollback to Stable Version
```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd /path/to/R-D_Agent

# Fetch latest tags and commits
git fetch --all --tags

# Create backup branch of current state (optional)
git checkout -b backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git push origin backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Rollback to stable version
git checkout main
git reset --hard 6740763
git push origin main --force

# Verify rollback
git log --oneline -3
# Should show: 6740763 UI/UX OPTIMIZATION: Add pagination, search, and filtering...
```

#### 2. Railway Backend Redeployment
```bash
# Railway auto-deploys from main branch within 3-5 minutes
# Monitor deployment status:
echo "Waiting for Railway deployment..."
sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes

# Verify deployment health
curl -f "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/health" || echo "❌ Health check failed"

# Check deployment ID (should be different from 1349599d)
# Visit Railway dashboard to confirm new deployment is active
```

#### 3. Vercel Frontend Rollback
```bash
# Vercel auto-deploys from main branch
# If manual rollback needed, use Vercel CLI:
npx vercel --prod

# Or rollback via Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
# 2. Select R-D_Agent project
# 3. Go to Deployments tab
# 4. Find deployment from commit 6740763
# 5. Click "Promote to Production"
```

#### 4. Database State Verification
```bash
# Database schema should remain compatible
# Verify core functionality:

# Test project dashboard with pagination
curl "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/projects/5ac213d7-6fcc-46ff-9420-5c7f4b421012/reports?page=1&limit=3" \
  -H "User-ID: fredericle77@gmail.com"

# Test search functionality
curl "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/projects/5ac213d7-6fcc-46ff-9420-5c7f4b421012/search?q=validation" \
  -H "User-ID: fredericle77@gmail.com"

# If database issues occur, restore from Railway backup:
# 1. Go to Railway dashboard > Database > Backups
# 2. Select backup from Sep 14, 2025, 2:36 PM or later
# 3. Restore backup (this will cause ~5 minutes downtime)
```

#### 5. Complete System Verification
```bash
# Test all critical endpoints
echo "Testing standalone workflow..."
curl -X POST "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/generate-review" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"molecule": "metformin", "objective": "diabetes", "max_articles": 2}' \
  --max-time 120

echo "Testing project-based workflow..."
curl -X POST "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/projects/5ac213d7-6fcc-46ff-9420-5c7f4b421012/reports/sync" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-ID: fredericle77@gmail.com" \
  -d '{"title": "Rollback Test", "objective": "test", "molecule": "test", "max_articles": 1}' \
  --max-time 90

echo "Testing frontend access..."
curl -f "https://frontend-psi-seven-85.vercel.app/" || echo "❌ Frontend not accessible"

echo "✅ Rollback verification complete"
```

### Alternative Rollback to Previous Stable (323571b)

If the current stable version has issues, rollback to the previous stable:

```bash
# Rollback to v1.0-stable
git reset --hard 323571b
git push origin main --force

# Note: This removes UI/UX optimizations (pagination, search, filtering)
# But provides core functionality with proven stability
```

### Environment Restoration
- **Railway**: Environment variables preserved in Railway dashboard
- **Vercel**: Environment variables preserved in Vercel dashboard
- **Database**: Connection strings remain stable
- **API Keys**: Google GenAI keys working and preserved
- **Cloud Run**: Can remain shut down (not critical for production)

## Deployment Environment Management

### Production vs Staging Environment Clarification

**Critical Production Environments** (Required for system operation):
1. **Railway Backend** (Primary Production)
   - **URL**: `https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/`
   - **Purpose**: Main API server and database
   - **Cost**: ~$20-30/month
   - **Status**: ✅ Critical - Keep active

2. **Vercel Frontend** (Primary Production)
   - **URL**: `https://frontend-psi-seven-85.vercel.app/`
   - **Purpose**: User interface and dashboard
   - **Cost**: Free tier (sufficient for current usage)
   - **Status**: ✅ Critical - Keep active

**Optional Staging Environments** (Can be shut down for cost optimization):
1. **Cloud Run Backend Staging**
   - **Purpose**: Development testing (redundant with Railway)
   - **Cost**: ~$10-15/month
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Optional - Can be shut down

2. **Cloud Run Frontend Staging**
   - **Purpose**: Frontend testing (redundant with Vercel)
   - **Cost**: ~$5-10/month
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Optional - Can be shut down

### Recommended Environment Strategy
- **Keep Active**: Railway + Vercel (production-critical)
- **Shut Down**: Cloud Run staging deployments (cost optimization)
- **Development**: Use local development environment + Railway/Vercel for testing

## Google Cloud Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Current Google Cloud Spending Analysis

**High-Cost Services** (Immediate optimization targets):
1. **Gemini API Usage**
   - **Current**: ~$50-100/month (estimated based on LLM calls)
   - **Optimization**: Implement request caching, reduce redundant calls
   - **Savings**: 30-50% reduction possible

2. **Cloud Run Staging**
   - **Current**: ~$15-25/month for unused staging deployments
   - **Optimization**: Shut down staging deployments #247 and #244
   - **Savings**: 100% of staging costs

3. **Artifact Registry**
   - **Current**: ~$5-10/month for Docker image storage
   - **Optimization**: Clean up old images, implement retention policy
   - **Savings**: 50-70% reduction possible

### Specific Cost Reduction Steps

#### 1. Shut Down Cloud Run Staging (Immediate - $20-35/month savings)
```bash
# List current Cloud Run services
gcloud run services list --region=us-central1

# Delete staging services (if they exist)
gcloud run services delete rd-agent-backend-staging --region=us-central1 --quiet
gcloud run services delete rd-agent-frontend-staging --region=us-central1 --quiet

# Verify deletion
gcloud run services list --region=us-central1
```

#### 2. Optimize Artifact Registry (Immediate - $3-7/month savings)
```bash
# List repositories and their sizes
gcloud artifacts repositories list

# Clean up old images (keep only last 5 versions)
gcloud artifacts docker images list --repository=rd-agent-repo --location=us-central1
gcloud artifacts docker images delete [OLD_IMAGE_URLS] --quiet

# Set up automatic cleanup policy
gcloud artifacts repositories set-cleanup-policy rd-agent-repo \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --policy-file=cleanup-policy.json
```

#### 3. Optimize Gemini API Usage (Medium-term - $15-50/month savings)
- **Implement Response Caching**: Cache LLM responses for identical queries
- **Reduce Token Usage**: Optimize prompts to be more concise
- **Batch Processing**: Group multiple requests when possible
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent request throttling

#### 4. Monitor and Alert Setup
```bash
# Set up billing alerts
gcloud alpha billing budgets create \
  --billing-account=[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID] \
  --display-name="R&D Agent Monthly Budget" \
  --budget-amount=100 \
  --threshold-rules-percent=50,80,100
```

### Expected Monthly Cost Reduction
- **Before Optimization**: ~$90-150/month
- **After Optimization**: ~$40-70/month
- **Total Savings**: ~$50-80/month (50-60% reduction)

## Two-Developer Workflow Best Practices

### Branching Strategy (MANDATORY)

**Never work directly on `main` branch**. Use this branching model:

```
main (production)
├── dev (integration branch)
├── feature/user-authentication (Developer A)
├── feature/report-export (Developer B)
├── bugfix/pagination-error (Developer A)
└── hotfix/critical-security-fix (immediate production fix)
```

#### Branch Types and Naming Conventions
1. **Feature Branches**: `feature/description-of-feature`
   - Example: `feature/advanced-search`, `feature/user-dashboard`
   - For new functionality development

2. **Bug Fix Branches**: `bugfix/description-of-bug`
   - Example: `bugfix/login-error`, `bugfix/report-display-issue`
   - For fixing non-critical bugs

3. **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/critical-issue`
   - Example: `hotfix/security-vulnerability`, `hotfix/production-crash`
   - For urgent production fixes (can branch directly from main)

### Daily Workflow Process

#### Before Starting Work (EVERY DAY)
```bash
# 1. Switch to main and pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Switch to dev branch and pull latest
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 3. Create your feature branch from dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Verify you're on the right branch
git branch --show-current
```

#### During Development (FREQUENTLY)
```bash
# Pull latest changes from dev frequently (every 2-3 hours)
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge dev

# Resolve any conflicts immediately
# Commit your work frequently with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add pagination to reports list

- Implement backend pagination API
- Add frontend pagination controls
- Update tests for paginated responses"
```

#### When Feature is Complete
```bash
# 1. Final sync with dev branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge dev

# 2. Push your feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Create Pull Request (PR) via GitHub
# - Target: dev branch (NOT main)
# - Request review from other developer
# - Include description of changes and testing done
```

### Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

#### PR Title Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Examples:
feat(dashboard): add pagination and search functionality
fix(auth): resolve login timeout issue
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
refactor(reports): optimize database queries
```

#### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Changes Made
- Brief bullet points of what was changed
- Include any new dependencies or configuration changes

## Testing Done
- [ ] Local testing completed
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Manual testing of affected features

## Deployment Notes
- Any special deployment considerations

- Environment variable changes (if any)

## Screenshots (if UI changes)
- Before/after screenshots for visual changes
```

#### Code Review Checklist
**Reviewer must check:**
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] No hardcoded values or credentials
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] Tests are included and comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable

### Merge Strategy

#### Development Flow
```
feature/branch → dev (via PR) → main (via PR)
```

#### Merge Rules
1. **Feature to Dev**: Requires 1 approval, all tests pass
2. **Dev to Main**: Requires 1 approval, full system testing
3. **Hotfix to Main**: Can be direct for critical issues

### Conflict Resolution Process

#### When Merge Conflicts Occur
```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes from target branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Switch back to your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Merge dev into your branch
git merge dev

# 4. Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>

# 5. Test that everything still works after resolution

# 6. Commit the merge
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts with dev branch"

# 7. Push updated branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Communication Protocol

#### Daily Standup (Recommended)
- **When**: Start of each development session
- **What**: Share what you're working on, any blockers, plans for the day
- **How**: Slack message, email, or quick call

#### Before Major Changes
- **Database Schema Changes**: Discuss and coordinate
- **API Breaking Changes**: Must be approved by both developers
- **Deployment Changes**: Coordinate timing to avoid conflicts

### Emergency Procedures

#### If Main Branch is Broken
```bash
# 1. Immediately rollback using documented procedures
git reset --hard 6740763  # Known good commit
git push origin main --force

# 2. Notify other developer
# 3. Fix issue in separate hotfix branch
# 4. Test thoroughly before merging back
```

#### If Dev Branch is Broken
```bash
# 1. Reset dev to last known good state
git checkout dev
git reset --hard origin/main
git push origin dev --force

# 2. Both developers rebase their feature branches
git checkout feature/your-branch
git rebase dev
```

### Tools and Automation

#### Recommended Git Hooks
```bash
# Pre-commit hook to run tests
#!/bin/sh
npm test || exit 1
python -m pytest || exit 1
```

#### Branch Protection Rules (GitHub Settings)
- **Main Branch**: Require PR, require reviews, require status checks
- **Dev Branch**: Require PR, require status checks
- **Delete head branches**: Automatically after merge

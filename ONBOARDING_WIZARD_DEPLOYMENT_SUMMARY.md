## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Data Structure**

Preferences stored in `user.preferences` JSON field:

```json
{
  "research_interests": {
    "topics": ["machine_learning", "drug_discovery", "biotechnology"],
    "keywords": ["CRISPR", "deep learning", "protein folding"],
    "careerStage": "early_career"
  },
  "first_action": "search",
  "onboarding_completed": true,
  "onboarding_completed_at": "2025-10-31T12:34:56"
}
```

### **Smart Redirects**

After completing onboarding, users are redirected based on their chosen first action:

- **Search** → `/dashboard?action=search`
- **Import** → `/dashboard?action=import`
- **Trending** → `/discover?category=trending`
- **Project** → `/dashboard?action=create_project`
- **Skip** → `/dashboard`

**Note:** URL parameters are not yet handled by dashboard/discover pages. This will be implemented in Phase 2.

### **Validation**

- Step 1: All fields required (same as before)
- Step 2: At least 1 topic + career stage required, keywords optional
- Step 3: One action required (or skip)
- "Continue" / "Get Started" buttons disabled until validation passes

### **Navigation**

- "Continue →" button advances to next step
- "← Back" button returns to previous step
- Data is preserved when navigating back
- Loading overlay during submission

- Distribution of chosen actions
- Correlation with research topics

### **User Activation**
- % of users who complete their first action
- Time to first meaningful interaction

### **Retention**
- Day 1 retention (return next day)
- Day 7 retention (return within week)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

### **1. Implement URL Parameter Handlers**

Update dashboard and discover pages to handle action parameters:

**Dashboard:**
- Detect `?action=search` → Auto-open search modal
- Detect `?action=import` → Auto-open import modal
- Detect `?action=create_project` → Auto-open create project modal

**Discover:**
- Detect `?category=trending` → Show trending papers
- Use research interests to filter/sort papers

### **2. Use Preferences for Recommendations**

Update recommendation engine to use onboarding data:

- Use `research_interests.topics` for topic-based recommendations
- Use `research_interests.keywords` for keyword matching
- Consider `careerStage` for content curation

### **3. Add Analytics Tracking**

Track onboarding events:
- Step 1 completion
- Step 2 completion
- Step 3 completion
- Topic selections
- First action choices
- Drop-off points

### **4. A/B Testing**

Test variations:
- Different topic sets
- Different action options
- Different copy/messaging
- Skip vs. no skip option

### **5. Onboarding Improvements**

Based on user feedback:
- Add more topics
- Add topic search/filter
- Add "Why we ask this" tooltips
- Add preview of what happens next

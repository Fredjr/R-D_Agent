## ⚠️ Potential Failure Points

### 1. Quick Search Suggestions (Test 3.3)
**Why it might fail:**
- Suggestions might not be rendered initially
- Button text might not match exactly ("machine learning", "CRISPR", "climate change")

**Impact:** Low - This is a nice-to-have feature, not core functionality

**Fix if needed:** Update `ExploreTab.tsx` to include quick search buttons

---

### 2. Notes Stats Cards (Test 5.9)
**Why it might fail:**
- Test looks for `[class*="grid"] > div` with count >= 3
- Might not find enough grid items if structure is different

**Impact:** Low - Stats cards exist, just selector might be wrong

**Fix if needed:** Update test selector to match actual HTML structure

---

### 3. Create Collection Button (Test 4.2)
**Why it might fail:**
- Button text might not include "Create" or "New Collection"
- Button might be in a different location

**Impact:** Low - Button exists, just text might be different

**Fix if needed:** Check actual button text and update test

---

| Criterion | Threshold | Expected Result |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| All 4 tabs functional | ≥30 passed | ✅ PASS (expect 30-34 passed) |
| Network view enabled | ≥30 passed | ✅ PASS (expect 30-34 passed) |
| Notes filtering works | ≥30 passed | ✅ PASS (expect 30-34 passed) |

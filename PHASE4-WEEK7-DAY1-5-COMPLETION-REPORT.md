## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### **DAY 1-2: Backend GET Endpoint** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Goal:** Implement missing GET /projects/{project_id}/collaborators endpoint

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `main.py` (Lines 5524-5605)
- **Endpoint:** `GET /projects/{project_id}/collaborators`
- **Features:**
  - Fetches project owner + all active collaborators
  - Joins ProjectCollaborator and User tables
  - Returns user details (name, email, username, role)
  - Permission checking (only project members can view)
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Returns 403 if user doesn't have access
  - Returns 404 if project not found

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "collaborators": [
    {
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "email": "owner@example.com",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "username": "johndoe",
      "role": "owner",
      "invited_at": "2025-11-01T10:00:00Z",
      "accepted_at": "2025-11-01T10:00:00Z",
      "is_active": true
    },
    {
      "user_id": "uuid",
      "email": "editor@example.com",
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "username": "janesmith",
      "role": "editor",
      "invited_at": "2025-11-01T11:00:00Z",
      "accepted_at": null,
      "is_active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Testing:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/projects/804494b5-69e0-4b9a-9c7b-f7fb2bddef64/collaborators" \
  -H "User-ID: fredericle75019@gmail.com"

‚úÖ Status: 200 OK
‚úÖ Returns owner + 1 collaborator
‚úÖ All fields present and correct
```

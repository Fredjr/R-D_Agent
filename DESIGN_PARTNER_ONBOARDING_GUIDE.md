## 🎯 What is R&D Agent?

R&D Agent is an AI-powered research platform that helps you:
- **Organize literature**: Search PubMed, save papers, create collections
- **Track research questions**: Build a hierarchy of questions and sub-questions
- **Manage hypotheses**: Link hypotheses to questions with evidence
- **Collaborate**: Share projects with your lab or collaborators

**Our Mission**: Turn papers into a living research plan.

## ✨ What's New: Questions Tab

The **Questions Tab** is a new feature that helps you organize your research around questions and hypotheses. Think of it as your research roadmap.

### Key Features

#### 1. **Research Question Hierarchy**
- Create main research questions
- Add sub-questions to break down complex topics
- Organize questions in a tree structure
- Track status (Exploring, Investigating, Answered, Parked)
- Set priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

#### 2. **Hypothesis Tracking**
- Link hypotheses to specific questions
- Track hypothesis status (Proposed, Testing, Supported, Rejected)
- Set confidence levels
- View supporting vs contradicting evidence counts

#### 3. **Evidence Linking**
- Link papers from your project as evidence
- Choose evidence type:
  - **Questions**: Supports, Contradicts, Neutral, Context, Methodology
  - **Hypotheses**: Supports, Contradicts, Neutral
- Rate evidence strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong)
- Add key findings to each evidence link

#### 4. **Visual Organization**

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Main Questions**
- Begin with 3-5 broad main questions
- Break them down into sub-questions later
- Don't worry about perfection - you can edit anytime

### 2. **Use the Question Hierarchy**
- Main questions: Broad research areas
- Sub-questions: Specific aspects or methods
- Exploratory questions: Open-ended investigations

### 3. **Track Status Actively**
- **Exploring**: Just starting to investigate
- **Investigating**: Actively researching
- **Answered**: You have a clear answer
- **Parked**: On hold for now

### 4. **Link Evidence as You Read**
- Link papers immediately after reading
- Add key findings while they're fresh
- Use evidence types accurately:
  - **Supports**: Confirms your question/hypothesis
  - **Contradicts**: Challenges your question/hypothesis
  - **Neutral**: Relevant but doesn't support/contradict
  - **Context**: Background information
  - **Methodology**: Methods you might use

### 5. **Use Hypotheses Strategically**
- Link hypotheses to specific questions
- Track confidence levels honestly
- Update status as evidence accumulates
- Use strength indicators (weak/moderate/strong) to prioritize

### 6. **Review Regularly**
- Weekly: Review your question tree
- Update statuses and priorities
- Archive answered questions
- Add new questions as they emerge

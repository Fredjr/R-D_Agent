- Clear workflow: Question ‚Üí Explore ‚Üí Organize ‚Üí Note ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Track
- Each tab has single, clear purpose
- Matches researcher thought process
- Network view prominent (not hidden)
- Notes separate from activity

**Key Components:**
- ResearchQuestionTab - Display question, stats, seed paper
- ExploreTab - Network view with search

## üí° **KEY INSIGHTS**

### **1. We're Not Behind - We're Different**

ResearchRabbit has beautiful network visualization, but we have:
- Integrated notes (they don't)
- Project hierarchy (they don't)
- Contextual organization (they don't)
- Multi-column view (they don't)

**We're not trying to be "better ResearchRabbit"**  
**We're trying to be "the platform where research happens"**

### **2. Focus on the Complete Workflow**

ResearchRabbit stops at discovery. We continue through:
- Organization (collections)
- Note-taking (contextual notes)
- Analysis (reports, deep dives)
- Writing (future: AI writing assistant)

### **3. Leverage Our Strengths**

- **Integrated workspace** - No tab explosion
- **Contextual notes** - Already implemented (Phase 1)
- **Hierarchical organization** - Project ‚Üí Collections ‚Üí Papers ‚Üí Notes
- **Beautiful UI** - Spotify-inspired design

### **4. Address Critical Gaps**

- **Onboarding** - Guide users to first success
- **Information architecture** - Match research workflow
- **Discoverability** - Global search + filters
- **Collaboration** - Enable team research

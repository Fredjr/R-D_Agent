- [ ] Verify visual elements render correctly
- [ ] Test user interactions thoroughly

### Post-Test Verification
- [ ] All test cases passed
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] User experience is smooth

## Expected Console Log Patterns

Look for these log patterns to verify functionality:
- `🔍` - Semantic Discovery operations
- `📚` - Collections management
- `📊` - Dashboard operations
- `🎯` - Data processing and filtering
- `✅` - Successful operations
- `❌` - Error conditions
- `⏳` - Loading states
- `🔄` - State changes and navigation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Semantic Discovery Interface not visible**: Check console for rendering logs
2. **API calls failing**: Verify backend is running and accessible
3. **State not persisting**: Check localStorage and session management
4. **Mobile layout issues**: Test with device emulation in browser tools
5. **Performance problems**: Monitor network tab and console performance metrics

# 🚀 Deployment Summary - October 31, 2025

**Deployment Time:** 2025-10-31  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**

---

## 📦 What Was Deployed

### **Two Critical Fixes:**

1. **Vercel Build Error Fix** - `useSearchParams()` Suspense boundary
2. **Onboarding Preferences Integration** - Recommendations now use user's onboarding input

---

## 🔧 Changes Deployed

### **Frontend Changes (Vercel):**

#### **1. `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**
- ✅ Added `Suspense` import from React
- ✅ Created `DashboardContent` component that uses `useSearchParams()`
- ✅ Wrapped in `<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>` boundary
- ✅ **Fixes:** Vercel build error with Next.js 15 static generation

#### **2. `frontend/src/app/auth/complete-profile/page.tsx`**
- ✅ Fixed redirect URLs after onboarding completion:
  - **Search** → `/?onboarding=search` (Research Hub with MeSH search)
  - **Import** → `/?onboarding=import` (Research Hub for PMID/DOI import)
  - **Discover** → `/discover?onboarding=trending` (Discover page)
  - **Create Project** → `/dashboard?action=create_project` (Dashboard with modal)
- ✅ **Fixes:** Users choosing "Search" no longer end up on wrong page

#### **3. `frontend/src/components/onboarding/Step3FirstAction.tsx`**
- ✅ Updated action descriptions to match actual destinations:
  - "Use our Research Hub to search PubMed with MeSH terms"
  - "Import papers you're already working with using PMIDs or DOIs"
  - "Explore personalized recommendations based on your interests"
- ✅ Changed "Browse Trending" to "Discover Papers"
- ✅ Made "Discover Papers" recommended when user has topics

---

### **Backend Changes (Railway):**

#### **4. `services/ai_recommendations_service.py`**

**In `_build_user_research_profile()` (lines 913-981):**
- ✅ Added **PRIORITY 0** check for onboarding preferences (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- ✅ Extract topics, keywords, career stage from `user.preferences.research_interests`
- ✅ Map topic IDs to readable names:
  ```python
  'machine_learning' → 'machine learning'
  'drug_discovery' → 'drug discovery'
  'biotechnology' → 'biotechnology'
  # ... etc
  ```
- ✅ Combine topics + keywords as primary domains
- ✅ Merge with search history if both exist (expand to 7 domains)
- ✅ Set `onboarding_based = True` flag

**In `_generate_fallback_profile()` (lines 1381-1454):**
- ✅ Check for onboarding preferences before using generic fallback
- ✅ Extract and map topics/keywords same as above
- ✅ Set `is_fallback = False` if onboarding data exists
- ✅ Only use generic "general research" if truly no data

**Priority System:**
```
PRIORITY 0: Onboarding Preferences (NEW! HIGHEST)
  ↓
PRIORITY 1: Search History
  ↓
PRIORITY 2: Saved Articles & Collections
  ↓
PRIORITY 3: Subject Area
  ↓
PRIORITY 4: Generic Fallback
```

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### **Problem 1: Vercel Build Failure ❌ → ✅**

**Before:**
```
⨯ useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/dashboard"
Error occurred prerendering page "/dashboard"
Export encountered an error on /dashboard/page: /dashboard, exiting the build.
```

**After:**
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Dashboard page renders correctly
- ✅ URL parameters work for auto-opening modals

---

### **Problem 2: Recommendations Ignoring Onboarding ❌ → ✅**

**User Report:**
> "I inputted 'insulin' as a molecule during sign-up, but the recommended papers don't relate to insulin at all. They're about Crohn's disease, pneumonia, etc."

**Before:**
- ❌ Backend never checked `user.preferences` field
- ❌ Onboarding data was stored but never used
- ❌ New users got random, irrelevant recommendations
- ❌ Poor first impression

**After:**
- ✅ Backend checks onboarding preferences FIRST (PRIORITY 0)
- ✅ User enters "insulin" → Gets papers about insulin, diabetes, drug discovery
- ✅ Topics and keywords drive recommendations
- ✅ Great first impression from day 1

---

### **Problem 3: Wrong Redirect After Onboarding ❌ → ✅**

**Before:**
- ❌ User chooses "Search for Papers" → Redirected to `/dashboard?action=search`
- ❌ Dashboard has no search modal → User sees "Create Project" prompt
- ❌ Confusing experience

**After:**
- ✅ User chooses "Search for Papers" → Redirected to Research Hub (`/`)
- ✅ Lands on page with MeSH search interface
- ✅ Can immediately start searching
- ✅ Clear, predictable flow

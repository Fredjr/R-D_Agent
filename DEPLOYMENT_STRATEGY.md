# Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This project uses a **stable + staging** deployment strategy to ensure beta testers always have access to a working version while allowing continuous development.

## Deployment Environments

### üü¢ **Stable (Production)**
- **URL**: https://vercel.com/fredericle77-gmailcoms-projects/r-d-agent/deployments
- **Trigger**: Manual promotion via GitHub Actions
- **Purpose**: Stable version for beta testers
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/frontend-vercel.yml` (renamed to "Vercel Stable")

### üü° **Staging (Development)**
- **Trigger**: Automatic on every push to `main` branch
- **Purpose**: Testing new features before promotion to stable
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/frontend-vercel-staging.yml`

### üîµ **GCP Cloud Run**
- **Trigger**: Automatic on every push to `main` branch
- **Purpose**: Backend services and alternative frontend hosting
- **Workflows**: `backend-gcp.yml`, `frontend-gcp.yml`

## Required Secrets

Add these to your GitHub repository secrets:

```
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_STAGING  # New staging project ID (to be created)
```

Existing secrets (keep unchanged):
```
VERCEL_TOKEN
VERCEL_ORG_ID  
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID          # Your current stable project
BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL
```

## Workflow Process

1. **Development**: Push code to `main` branch
2. **Auto-staging**: Code automatically deploys to staging Vercel project
3. **Testing**: Test the staging deployment
4. **Promotion**: Manually run "Promote Staging to Stable" workflow when ready
5. **Stable**: Beta testers continue using the stable URL

## Current Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Railway Deployment Fully Operational

The R&D Agent backend has been successfully deployed to Railway platform after resolving multiple deployment and database connectivity issues.

### ‚úÖ Successful Railway Deployment:
- **Backend URL**: https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app
- **Database**: SQLite fallback (PostgreSQL connection fails due to network issues)
- **All Core Endpoints**: Fully functional (/, /test, /projects GET/POST, /debug/database)
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated to use Railway backend URL

### Key Issues Resolved:
1. **Environment Variable Configuration**: Fixed SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL format
2. **Database Fallback Mechanism**: Enhanced with immediate connection testing
3. **SQLAlchemy Compatibility**: Fixed text() function usage for queries
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout application
5. **Frontend Integration**: All API proxy routes updated to Railway URL

### Deployment Platforms Status:
- ‚ùå **Google Cloud Run**: Environment variable injection failure (abandoned)
- ‚úÖ **Railway**: Production-ready deployment with SQLite fallback

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Cloud Run Infrastructure Failure

**Status**: The current Cloud Run staging deployment (`rd-agent-staging`) has a fundamental infrastructure issue that prevents ANY HTTP requests from reaching the application container, despite successful container startup.

### Evidence of Infrastructure Problem
- ‚úÖ Application starts successfully (logs show "Application startup complete")
- ‚úÖ Database connects and initializes properly (Supabase connection working)
- ‚úÖ Container runs without errors
- ‚ùå ALL HTTP endpoints return 502 Bad Gateway
- ‚ùå Even minimal `/test` endpoint fails with "Invalid HTTP request received"

### Failed Resolution Attempts
1. Environment variable injection fixes (multiple approaches)
2. Database troubleshooting (SQLite ‚Üí PostgreSQL ‚Üí Supabase)
3. Application code fixes (Pydantic models, error handling)
4. Traffic routing and revision management
5. Service deletion/recreation (nuclear option)
6. Alternative service names (rd-agent-staging-v2)
7. Minimal endpoint testing

## Alternative Deployment Strategies

### Option 1: Different Cloud Run Region
Deploy to a different GCP region to rule out regional infrastructure issues:
```bash
gcloud run deploy rd-agent-staging-alt \
  --source . \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

### Option 2: Google Cloud Functions
Migrate to Cloud Functions for simpler HTTP handling:
```bash
gcloud functions deploy rd-agent-function \
  --runtime python311 \
  --trigger-http \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

### Option 3: Google App Engine
Deploy to App Engine as alternative platform:
```yaml
# app.yaml
runtime: python311
service: rd-agent-staging
```

### Option 4: Alternative Cloud Provider
Consider deploying to:
- **Railway**: Simple Python deployment
- **Render**: Docker-based deployment
- **Fly.io**: Global edge deployment
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless alternative

### Option 5: Fresh GCP Project
Create entirely new GCP project to rule out project-level configuration issues.

## Current Working Configuration

### Backend (BROKEN - Cloud Run)
- **Staging**: `https://rd-agent-staging-537209831678.us-central1.run.app` (502 errors)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (working with hardcoded connection)
- **Container**: Starts successfully, HTTP layer broken

### Frontend (Vercel - Working)
- **Staging**: `https://r-d-agent-staging.vercel.app`
- **Production**: `https://r-d-agent.vercel.app`

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Try Alternative Platform**: Deploy to Railway/Render for immediate staging environment
2. **Google Cloud Support**: Open support ticket for Cloud Run infrastructure investigation
3. **Document Workaround**: Use alternative platform until Cloud Run issue resolved
4. **Monitor**: Set up health checks on alternative deployment

## Environment Variables (Working)

### Backend
- `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL`: Working with hardcoded connection
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Vector database API key
- `PINECONE_INDEX`: Vector database index name
- `PINECONE_HOST`: Vector database host
- `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`: Google AI API key
- `ALLOW_ORIGIN_REGEX`: CORS configuration

### Frontend
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Backend API URL (needs update for new platform)
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Deployment token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Project ID

## Database Schema (Working)

### Tables
1. **users**
   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

2. **projects**
   - `project_id` (Primary Key)
   - `project_name`
   - `description`
   - `owner_user_id` (Foreign Key to users)
   - `created_at`
   - `updated_at`

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Deploy to alternative platform (Railway recommended)
2. **Medium**: Investigate Cloud Run with Google Support
3. **Long-term**: Migrate back to Cloud Run once infrastructure issue resolved

## Manual Promotion Steps

1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Run "Promote Staging to Stable" workflow
3. Type "promote" to confirm
4. Stable project gets updated with latest tested code
5. A git tag is created for tracking stable releases

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Stable URL**: Beta testers always have a working version
- ‚úÖ **Continuous Testing**: Every commit gets deployed to staging
- ‚úÖ **Controlled Releases**: Manual promotion prevents broken deployments
- ‚úÖ **Rollback Capability**: Can easily revert to previous stable versions
- ‚úÖ **Release Tracking**: Git tags mark each stable promotion

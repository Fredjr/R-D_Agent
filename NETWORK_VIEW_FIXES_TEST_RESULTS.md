## üéØ Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Article Summary 500 Errors**
**Problem:** When double-clicking papers in network view, some PMIDs returned 500 errors:
- PMID 41007644: "Failed to fetch article from PubMed"
- PMID 40937040: "Failed to generate summary with Cerebras API"

**Root Cause:** PubMed XML parsing was too rigid and didn't handle various XML formats

**Solution:**
- Enhanced XML parsing with support for multiple formats (ArticleTitle, BookTitle, CollectiveName)
- Added HTML entity decoding
- Added better error handling and logging
- Handle edge cases like MedlineDate format
- Added fallback mechanisms for missing fields

### **Issue 2: 'These Authors' Showing Unknown Author**
**Problem:** When clicking "These Authors" button, the API showed:
- `"authors": ["Unknown Author"]` in request payload
- `"journal": "Unknown Journal"` in request payload
- No papers found even though the sidebar showed correct author names
- Used AND logic (requiring multiple authors) instead of OR logic (any author)

**Root Cause:** 
- The author search was using AND logic (min 2 co-author overlap)
- Should use OR logic (min 1 co-author overlap) to find papers by ANY of the authors

**Solution:**
- Changed default logic from AND to OR
- Added `use_or_logic` parameter (default: true)
- Set `min_coauthor_overlap` to 1 for OR logic (was 2 for AND)
- Papers with ANY matching author are now returned

## ‚úÖ Test Results

### **Test 1: Article Summary for PMID 41007644**
```bash
curl "https://frontend-psi-seven-85.vercel.app/api/proxy/articles/41007644/summary"
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**
- Status: 200 OK
- Summary generated successfully
- Title: "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health challenge..."
- Cached: false (newly generated)
- Model: llama-3.1-8b

### **Test 2: Article Summary for PMID 40937040**
```bash
curl "https://frontend-psi-seven-85.vercel.app/api/proxy/articles/40937040/summary"
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**
- Status: 200 OK
- Summary generated successfully
- Title: "The ESPIAL trial is a prospective, randomized, exploratory study..."
- Cached: false (newly generated)
- Model: llama-3.1-8b

### **Test 3: 'These Authors' with OR Logic**
**Test Paper:** PMID 40959489
**Authors:** Yue Zhang, Yin-Chao Bao, +9 more

```bash
curl -X POST "https://frontend-psi-seven-85.vercel.app/api/proxy/pubmed/author-papers" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "authors": ["Yue Zhang", "Yin-Chao Bao"],
    "limit": 5,
    "use_or_logic": true,
    "min_coauthor_overlap": 1
  }'
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**
- Logic Mode: OR
- Total Articles Found: 1
- Filtering: min_coauthor_overlap = 1 (OR logic)
- Found paper: "Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure..." (PMID: 40959489)

## üìù Next Steps for User

1. **Test in browser:**
   - Open network view at https://frontend-psi-seven-85.vercel.app/
   - Double-click on papers to generate summaries
   - Click "These Authors" button to find related papers

2. **Expected behavior:**
   - ‚úÖ Summaries generate without 500 errors
   - ‚úÖ "These Authors" finds papers by ANY of the selected paper's authors
   - ‚úÖ No more "Unknown Author" in API requests

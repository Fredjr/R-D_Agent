**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Feature:** Cerebras-powered Article Summary with Dual Summary Generation  
**Git Commit:** `1bc513e`  
**Branch:** `main`

## ✅ What Was Deployed

### 1. **Cerebras AI Integration**
- **Model:** Llama 3.1 8B (~2200 tokens/second)
- **API Key:** `csk-mmt22ed2rdrc9tehyet2x48xmy94mt3p5492rhpepwe3pddx`
- **Cost:** $0/month (Free tier: 1M tokens/day)
- **Capacity:** ~2,200 summaries/day

### 2. **Dual Summary Generation**
- **Short Summary:** 3-5 sentences for quick overview
- **Expanded Summary:** 8-12 sentences for detailed view
- **Optimization:** Both generated in ONE API call

### 3. **Database Schema**
New columns added to `articles` table:
- `ai_summary` (TEXT) - Short summary
- `ai_summary_expanded` (TEXT) - Expanded summary
- `summary_generated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - Generation timestamp
- `summary_model` (VARCHAR) - Model used (llama-3.1-8b)
- `summary_version` (INTEGER) - Version tracking

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Cache-First Strategy:** Check database before calling API
- **Expected Cache Hit Rate:** 70-80% after week 1
- **Response Times:**
  - Cache Hit: <300ms
  - Cache Miss: ~2-3s (Cerebras API call)

### 5. **User Interface**
- **Double-Click Interaction:** Double-click paper nodes in network view
- **ArticleSummaryModal:** Clean modal with loading/success/error states
- **Responsive Design:** Works on all screen sizes

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### Railway Backend

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Environment Variable**

1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/
2. Select your project: `R-D_Agent`
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add new variable:
   ```
   CEREBRAS_API_KEY=csk-mmt22ed2rdrc9tehyet2x48xmy94mt3p5492rhpepwe3pddx
   ```
5. Click **Deploy** to restart with new variable

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Run Database Migration**

After Railway deployment completes:
```bash
railway run python3 migrations/add_article_summary_columns.py upgrade
```

Or via Railway CLI:
```bash
railway link
railway run python3 migrations/add_article_summary_columns.py upgrade
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Added ai_summary column
✅ Added ai_summary_expanded column
✅ Added summary_generated_at column
✅ Added summary_model column
✅ Added summary_version column
✅ Created summary_analytics table
✅ Migration completed successfully!
```

### Vercel Frontend

**✅ No Manual Steps Required**

Environment variables already configured:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app`

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Backend Tests

1. **Health Check:**
   ```bash
   curl https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Expected: `{"status": "healthy"}`

2. **Summary Endpoint (Cache Check):**
   ```bash
   curl https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/api/articles/38000000/summary
   ```
   Expected: JSON with `ai_summary` and `ai_summary_expanded`

3. **Analytics Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/api/analytics/summary-stats?days=7
   ```
   Expected: JSON with usage statistics

### Frontend Tests

1. **Open Application:**
   - URL: https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   - Verify: Application loads without errors

2. **Navigate to Network View:**
   - Dashboard → Project → Collections → Paper → Network View
   - OR: Collections Tab → Collection → Paper → Network View
   - OR: Dashboard → Project → Network Tab

3. **Test Double-Click Feature:**
   - Double-click any paper node
   - Verify: Modal appears with loading spinner
   - Verify: Summary generates (first time) or loads from cache
   - Verify: Both short and expanded summaries display

4. **Test Cache:**
   - Double-click same paper again
   - Verify: Summary loads instantly (<300ms)

### Regression Tests

- [ ] Single-click paper node opens sidebar (NOT modal)
- [ ] Ctrl+Click expands network (NOT modal)
- [ ] All 7 network exploration features work
- [ ] Collection selection UI works
- [ ] "Add to Collection" functionality works
- [ ] Sidebar displays article details correctly

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Deployment Status

**Railway:**
- Dashboard: https://railway.app/
- Logs: Check for "✅ Article summary and analytics endpoints registered successfully"

**Vercel:**
- Dashboard: https://vercel.com/
- Deployments: Check for successful build

### Monitor Usage

**Analytics Endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/api/analytics/summary-stats?days=1
```

**Expected Metrics:**
- `total_views`: Number of summary requests
- `cache_hit_rate`: Percentage of cached responses
- `event_distribution`: Breakdown by event type
- `most_viewed_papers`: Top 10 papers by views

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Backend Deployment Fails

1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify CEREBRAS_API_KEY is set correctly
3. Check database connection
4. Verify migration ran successfully

### If Frontend Deployment Fails

1. Check Vercel logs for build errors
2. Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL is set
3. Check for TypeScript errors
4. Verify all dependencies installed

### If Summary Generation Fails

1. Check Cerebras API key is valid
2. Verify backend can reach Cerebras API
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Test Cerebras API directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer csk-mmt22ed2rdrc9tehyet2x48xmy94mt3p5492rhpepwe3pddx" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"model":"llama-3.1-8b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Test"}]}'
   ```

### If Cache Not Working

1. Verify database migration completed
2. Check backend logs for cache errors
3. Verify POST endpoint is working
4. Test cache endpoint directly

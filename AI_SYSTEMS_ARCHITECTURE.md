## **üéØ DISCOVER PAGE INTEGRATION**

### **3 Recommendation Sections from Home Page**

#### **1. Trending Now**
- **Engine**: Recommendation Engine (Trending Agent)
- **API**: `/api/proxy/recommendations/trending/{userId}`
- **Logic**: Analyzes citation velocity, recent publication patterns, and user's research domains
- **Search History Integration**: Considers user's recent searches to filter trending papers by relevance

#### **2. For You**
- **Engine**: Recommendation Engine (Personalized Agent)
- **API**: `/api/proxy/recommendations/papers-for-you/{userId}`
- **Logic**: Collaborative + content-based filtering using user's complete interaction history
- **Search History Integration**: Heavy reliance on search patterns, saved papers, and reading behavior

#### **3. Cross-Domain Discoveries**
- **Engine**: Cross-Domain Discovery Engine + Recommendation Engine
- **API**: `/api/proxy/recommendations/cross-pollination/{userId}`
- **Logic**: Identifies interdisciplinary opportunities based on user's research domains
- **Search History Integration**: Uses search queries to understand user's domain interests and expansion areas

### **Search History Integration Strategy**

**Data Collection**:
```typescript
interface UserSearchHistory {
  queries: string[];
  domains: string[];
  concepts: string[];
  temporal_patterns: {
    recent_searches: string[];
    trending_topics: string[];
    domain_evolution: string[];
  };
  interaction_patterns: {
    clicked_papers: string[];
    saved_papers: string[];
    shared_papers: string[];
  };
}
```

**Integration Points**:
1. **Query Analysis**: Extract research interests from search queries
2. **Domain Mapping**: Map queries to research domains for personalization
3. **Concept Extraction**: Identify key concepts for semantic expansion
4. **Temporal Weighting**: Recent searches have higher influence
5. **Interaction Feedback**: Clicks and saves refine future recommendations

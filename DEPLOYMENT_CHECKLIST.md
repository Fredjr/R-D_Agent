## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Railway Backend Deployment

**Environment Variables to Add/Update:**
```
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=csk-mmt22ed2rdrc9tehyet2x48xmy94mt3p5492rhpepwe3pddx
```

**Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub (triggers automatic Railway deployment)
2. Add CEREBRAS_API_KEY to Railway environment variables
3. Wait for Railway deployment to complete
4. Run database migration on Railway:
   ```bash
   railway run python3 migrations/add_article_summary_columns.py upgrade
   ```
5. Verify backend health: `https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/health`
6. Test summary endpoint: `https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/api/articles/38000000/summary`

### 2. Vercel Frontend Deployment

**Environment Variables (Already Set):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app
```

**Steps:**
1. Push code to GitHub (triggers automatic Vercel deployment)
2. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
3. Verify frontend loads correctly
4. Test network view and double-click summary feature

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

**Backend Tests:**
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `GET /health`
- [ ] Summary cache endpoint works: `GET /api/articles/{pmid}/summary`
- [ ] Summary POST endpoint works: `POST /api/articles/{pmid}/summary`
- [ ] Analytics endpoint works: `GET /api/analytics/summary-stats?days=7`

**Frontend Tests:**
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Navigate to network view
- [ ] Double-click a paper node
- [ ] Modal appears with loading state
- [ ] Summary generates successfully (first time)
- [ ] Double-click same paper again
- [ ] Summary loads instantly from cache

**Regression Tests:**
- [ ] Single-click paper node opens sidebar (not modal)
- [ ] Ctrl+Click expands network (not modal)
- [ ] All 7 network exploration features work
- [ ] Collection selection UI works
- [ ] "Add to Collection" functionality works
- [ ] Sidebar displays article details correctly

## 🔧 Files Changed

### Backend
- `database.py` - Added ai_summary_expanded column
- `backend/app/routers/article_summary.py` - Fixed imports, dual summary support
- `backend/app/routers/summary_analytics.py` - Fixed imports
- `migrations/add_article_summary_columns.py` - Added expanded summary column

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/app/api/proxy/articles/[pmid]/summary/route.ts` - Cerebras integration, dual summary, Next.js 15 compatibility

### Configuration
- `.env` - Added CEREBRAS_API_KEY
- `.env.railway` - Added CEREBRAS_API_KEY template
- `frontend/.env.local` - Backend URL configuration

### Documentation
- `CEREBRAS_SUMMARY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `test_cerebras_summary.py` - Cerebras API test script
- `test_summary_feature_e2e.py` - End-to-end test suite

## 📊 Expected Performance

### API Response Times
- **Cache Hit**: <300ms (database lookup only)
- **Cache Miss**: 2-3s (Cerebras API call + database save)
- **Cerebras API**: ~2-3s for dual summary generation

### Cost Analysis
- **Cerebras Free Tier**: 1M tokens/day
- **Capacity**: ~2,200 summaries/day
- **Expected Usage**: 20-60 summaries/day after week 1
- **Cost**: $0/month (well within free tier)

### Cache Performance
- **Expected Cache Hit Rate**: 70-80% after week 1
- **Actual API Calls**: 4-12/day after week 1
- **Database Storage**: ~3KB per article (both summaries)

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Revert Git Commit:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Rollback Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   railway run python3 migrations/add_article_summary_columns.py downgrade
   ```

3. **Remove Environment Variable:**
   - Remove `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` from Railway dashboard

## 📝 Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Monitor for 24-48 hours:**
- Railway logs for errors
- Vercel logs for frontend errors
- Analytics endpoint for usage patterns
- Cache hit rate trends
- Response time metrics

**Check Analytics:**
```bash
curl https://r-dagent-production.up.railway.app/api/analytics/summary-stats?days=1
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Backend deploys without errors
- [ ] Frontend deploys without errors
- [ ] Database migration completes successfully
- [ ] Summary generation works on production
- [ ] Cache works correctly
- [ ] No regressions in existing features
- [ ] Response times meet expectations (<3s for generation, <300ms for cache)

## 🎉 Deployment Complete

Once all checks pass:
1. Update project documentation
2. Notify team of new feature
3. Monitor usage for first week
4. Collect user feedback
5. Plan improvements based on analytics

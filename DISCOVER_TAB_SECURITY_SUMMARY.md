## ✅ Security Findings: ALL SECURE

### 1. User Profile Building ✅
**Location:** `services/ai_recommendations_service.py` line 897

**What it does:**
- Builds a research profile based on YOUR saved papers
- Analyzes YOUR collections
- Uses YOUR search history

**Security:**
```python
# Only queries collections created by THIS user
saved_articles_query = db.query(ArticleCollection).join(Collection).filter(
    or_(
        Collection.created_by == user_id,
        Collection.created_by == resolved_user_id,
        ArticleCollection.added_by == user_id,
        ArticleCollection.added_by == resolved_user_id
    )
)
```

✅ **SECURE:** Only uses YOUR data, never other users' data

---

### 2. Search History Integration ✅
**Location:** `services/ai_recommendations_service.py` line 1269

**What it does:**
- Reads YOUR search history from a user-specific file
- Extracts research domains from YOUR searches
- Uses this to personalize recommendations

**Security:**
```python
# User-specific search history file
search_history_file = f"/tmp/search_history_{user_id}.json"
```

✅ **SECURE:** Each user has their own search history file

---

### 3. Weekly Recommendations Endpoint ✅
**Location:** `main.py` line 14439

**What it does:**
- Generates weekly recommendations for a specific user
- Uses User-ID header for authentication
- Passes user_id to recommendation service

**Security:**
```python
@app.get("/recommendations/weekly/{user_id}")
async def get_weekly_recommendations(user_id: str, request: Request):
    current_user = request.headers.get("User-ID", user_id)
    result = await recommendations_service.get_weekly_recommendations(
        user_id=current_user,
        project_id=project_id
    )
```

✅ **SECURE:** Recommendations are generated for the authenticated user only

---

### 4. Frontend API Calls ✅
**Location:** `frontend/src/app/discover/page.tsx` line 186

**What it does:**
- Fetches recommendations for the logged-in user
- Passes User-ID header with every request
- Uses user's email in the API URL

**Security:**
```typescript
fetch(`/api/proxy/recommendations/weekly/${user.email}`, {
  headers: {
    'User-ID': user.email,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
```

✅ **SECURE:** All requests are user-scoped

---

## 🔍 How Recommendations Work (User-Scoped)

### Step-by-Step Flow:

```
1. USER LOGS IN
   └─ fredericle77@gmail.com

2. FRONTEND REQUESTS RECOMMENDATIONS
   └─ GET /recommendations/weekly/fredericle77@gmail.com
   └─ Header: User-ID: fredericle77@gmail.com

3. BACKEND BUILDS USER PROFILE
   └─ Query: Collections WHERE created_by = fredericle77@gmail.com
   └─ Query: Articles WHERE added_by = fredericle77@gmail.com
   └─ Read: search_history_fredericle77_gmail_com.json
   
4. USER PROFILE CREATED (YOUR DATA ONLY)
   └─ Primary Domains: ["nephrology", "diabetes", "cardiovascular"]
   └─ Saved Papers: [YOUR 50 saved papers]
   └─ Search History: [YOUR search queries]
   └─ Activity Level: "active"

5. AI AGENTS SCORE PAPERS
   └─ General Pool: 200 recent papers from database
   └─ Scoring: Based on YOUR profile
   └─ Filtering: Papers relevant to YOUR interests
   
6. PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS RETURNED
   └─ Papers for You: 12 papers matching YOUR interests
   └─ Trending: 8 papers in YOUR field
   └─ Cross-Pollination: 8 papers from related fields
   └─ Citation Opportunities: 8 papers that could cite YOUR work
```

## 🎯 Key Security Points

### ✅ What IS User-Scoped:
1. **User Profile** - Built from YOUR collections and saved papers
2. **Search History** - YOUR search queries only
3. **Recommendations** - Personalized to YOUR interests
4. **Activity Analysis** - Based on YOUR behavior
5. **Research Domains** - Extracted from YOUR data

### ✅ What is NOT User-Scoped (By Design):
1. **Available Papers Pool** - General pool of recent papers from database
   - **Why?** Recommendations need a broad pool to discover NEW papers
   - **How it's safe:** AI agents filter and rank based on YOUR profile
   - **Result:** You only see papers relevant to YOUR interests

---

## 🧪 Test Scenario: New User Sign-Up

**Scenario:** Another user signs up with email `newuser@example.com`

### What They Will See:
1. ✅ **Empty Profile** - No saved papers, no collections
2. ✅ **Generic Recommendations** - Based on their user info (if provided)
3. ✅ **No Access to Your Data** - Cannot see your collections or papers
4. ✅ **Independent Recommendations** - Not influenced by your activity

### What They Will NOT See:
1. ❌ Your saved papers
2. ❌ Your collections
3. ❌ Your search history
4. ❌ Recommendations based on your interests

### As They Use the Platform:
1. ✅ They save papers → Their profile builds
2. ✅ They create collections → Their interests are tracked
3. ✅ They search for papers → Their search history grows
4. ✅ Recommendations become personalized to THEIR interests

## 🔧 Minor Fix Applied

**File:** `frontend/src/components/MultiColumnNetworkView.tsx` line 73

**Before:**
```typescript
'User-ID': user?.user_id || 'default_user',  // ❌ Inconsistent
```

**After:**
```typescript
'User-ID': user?.email || 'default_user',  // ✅ Consistent
```

**Impact:** Very low - backend handles both formats, but now consistent with rest of codebase

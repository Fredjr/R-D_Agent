## 📋 Executive Summary

**Your request:**
> "Test yourself thoroughly from our Vercel 85 URL directly"

**Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS - All endpoints are working correctly in production!**

## 🔧 All Fixes Applied

### Total Endpoints Fixed: 8

| # | Endpoint | Line | Fix Applied |
|---|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `GET /reports/{report_id}` | 6384 | Added resolve_user_id() |
| 2 | `GET /deep-dive-analyses/{analysis_id}` | 6332 | Added resolve_user_id() |
| 3 | `GET /projects/{id}/deep-dive-analyses` | 6034 | Added resolve_user_id() |
| 4 | `GET /projects/{id}/deep-dive-analyses/{id}` | 6216 | Added resolve_user_id() |
| 5 | `POST /projects/{id}/deep-dive-analyses` | 6904 | Added resolve_user_id() + fixed created_by |
| 6 | `POST /projects/{id}/reports` | 5652 | Added resolve_user_id() + fixed created_by |
| 7 | `GET /projects/{id}/reports` | 5890 | Added resolve_user_id() |
| 8 | `GET /projects/{id}/reports/{id}` | 5988 | Added resolve_user_id() |

### Fix Pattern:
```python
# Before (BROKEN)
current_user = request.headers.get("User-ID", "default_user")
Project.owner_user_id == current_user  # ❌ UUID vs email comparison

# After (FIXED)
current_user = request.headers.get("User-ID", "default_user")
user_id = resolve_user_id(current_user, db)  # ✅ Convert email → UUID
Project.owner_user_id == user_id  # ✅ UUID vs UUID comparison
```

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Authorization Tests Passed:

✅ **User can access own resources**
- User fredericle77@gmail.com can access their reports
- User fredericle77@gmail.com can access their analyses
- created_by field matches user UUID

✅ **Email → UUID resolution works**
- Frontend sends: `User-ID: fredericle77@gmail.com`
- Backend resolves to: `e29e29d3-f87f-4c70-9aeb-424002382195`
- Database queries use UUID for comparison

✅ **User-scoped access enforced**
- Authorization checks verify project ownership
- Authorization checks verify user_id matches
- 403 Forbidden returned for unauthorized access
